### A few details about this project

- Analyzed and graphed 273 years of sunspot counts using Circular, Spiral and Fourier analysis to look for patterns and derive there frequency.
- Wrote code in python to numerically and graphically analyze the data of 80,000+ sunspots over the 273 year timeframe.
- Prepared a final poster and wrote a report for the same.

**Note:** This project is ancient (2 years old) and most of the work for this has gotten deleted. The only thing that still remains relatively intact is Maths_Project_Poster.jpg. So you can take a look at that. And the first few pages of the report are perfectly fine too!
